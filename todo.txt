 - I think the the way I have my back end right now is not the right way.

	To fix that 
	- I need to run another app inside the back end file
	- That will pretty much do all the things that are needed like everything that I am doing on the font end rn
	- Coz all i need the front end to do is to show what it shows that't it.
	as for the manual stuff i need do couple things
		- Finish registration (without card)
		- Add entries manually (without card)
	- I also need to build out authentication as well.
		- So that the system knows that a mentor wants to make some			changes.
	- I think this needs to kind of happen before I build the manual stuf
